## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JQuery

### What I learned


I learned how to build a hamburger menu for mobile devices. I did this through designing a modal to slide in when hamburger icon is clicked. 

I used a toggle feature for the desktop navigation.

This project reinforced the importance of mobile responsiveness. 

### Continued development

I want to build more hamburger menus. 

I struggled with the x-positioning of background images, want to keep practicing this. 

Would like to rebuild the content sections using CSS grid. Think it would be good practice to build comfort with CSS grid.
